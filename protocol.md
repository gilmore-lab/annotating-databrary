Purpose
-------

1.  To add annotations to shared Databrary videos.
2.  To make it easier for users to find videos they want to reuse.
3.  To make the new (in planning) Databrary search engine more powerful.

Examples of Computer Vision models applied to videos
----------------------------------------------------

-   [YOLO](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/) object detection
-   [OpenPose](https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose) pose estimation algorithm
-   [Atomic Visual Actions](http://research.google.com/ava/)

Planning
--------

-   What are highest priority annotations?
    -   Setting (home, lab, museum)
    -   Indoor/outdoor
    -   People
        -   infant, child, adolescent, adult
    -   Actions
    -   Objects
-   How to sample?
    -   Time sampling?
        -   Every X s: {10, 20, 30, 60}
    -   How to code?
