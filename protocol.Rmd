## Purpose

1. To add annotations to shared Databrary videos.
2. To make it easier for users to find videos they want to reuse.
3. To make the new (in planning) Databrary search engine more powerful.

## Planning

- What are highest priority annotations?
    - Setting (home, lab, museum)
    - Indoor/outdoor
    - People
        - infant, child, adolescent, adult
    - Actions
    - Objects
- How to sample?
    - Time sampling?
        - Every X s: {10, 20, 30, 60}
    - How to code?
